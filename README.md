## Software Development Lifecycle Stages

### Planning

#### What roles did your team take on?
Our development team consisted of the following roles:

1. **UI/UX Designer:** Designed the user interface, ensuring a seamless and visually appealing user experience.

2. **Scrum Facilitator:** Took the lead with organisation and keeping everyone motivated and on track.
   
3. **QA Tester:** Conducted testing and quality assurance to identify and resolve bugs and issues.

4. **DevOps:** Deployed the site.

#### Did these roles help your team work effectively?
Yes, having clearly defined roles and responsibilities helped our team work effectively. It ensured that each team member had a specific focus, reducing overlap and miscommunication. Collaboration between roles, such as the product manager and UI/UX designer, was crucial to aligning the product's design with user needs and priorities.

### Analysis

#### What might be the intended and unintended consequences of building this product?
Intended Consequences:
- **Improved Gardening Knowledge:** Users can become more knowledgeable about gardening through the app's educational content.
- **Better Garden Planning:** Users can plan their gardens more effectively, resulting in healthier and more abundant harvests.
- **Community Building:** The app can foster a sense of community among gardening enthusiasts, allowing them to share knowledge and experiences.

Unintended Consequences:
- **Overreliance on Technology:** Some users might become overly dependent on the app for gardening guidance, potentially neglecting the hands-on experience of gardening.
- **Privacy Concerns:** Collecting user data for personalized recommendations may raise privacy concerns if not handled transparently and securely.
- **Environmental Impact:** Encouraging gardening may have a positive impact on the environment, but there could be unintended environmental consequences if users don't follow sustainable practices.

By addressing the intended and unintended consequences, we can continue to refine and improve the Roots app, ensuring that it remains a valuable tool for gardeners while mitigating any potential drawbacks.
